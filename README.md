# CI/CD of NodeJS web app to Kubernetes using Jenkins, Docker and Helm
This repository has a simple example for packing a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) web application in [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and deploying it to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) using [Helm](https://helm.sh/).
All this is done with [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/).

## Details
This pipeline is executed with Jenkins and assumes it's already setup with 
- Docker
- Kubectl
- Helm

These tools are required and are not in the scope of this example.
